# TribalAuthentica

## Overview
TribalAuthentica is a decentralized application (dApp) for authenticating and classifying tribal masks using AI and community validation. The platform combines machine learning with human expertise to create a reliable authentication system for tribal artifacts.

## Features
- AI-powered tribal mask classification
- Decentralized community validation
- NFT minting for authenticated masks
- Marketplace integration
- Self-improving AI model through validated data feedback

## How It Works

### 1. Submission Process
- Connect MetaMask wallet to Sepolia testnet
- Upload 1-2 photos of the mask (front and back views)
- Optionally provide additional metadata:
  - Country of origin
  - Known tribal group

### 2. AI Classification
- Automatic AI analysis upon upload
- Generates top 3 probable tribal group classifications
- Displays confidence percentages for each suggestion

### 3. Validation System
- Submissions enter a pool for community validation
- Requires 10 independent validators
- Each validator:
  - Confirms authenticity (Yes/No)
  - Selects tribal classification from:
    - Top 3 AI suggestions
    - "Other tribe" option
- Consensus reached at 8/10 matching votes

### 4. NFT Creation
Upon successful validation:
- Automatic NFT minting
- NFT includes:
  - Original mask images
  - "Authenticated by TribalAuthentica" certification
  - Verified tribal classification
- NFT is transferred to original submitter
- Item becomes available for marketplace trading

### 5. AI Model Improvement
- Validated classifications feed back into AI model
- Continuous learning system
- Improves accuracy over time
